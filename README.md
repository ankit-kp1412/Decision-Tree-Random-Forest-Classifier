# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Classifier car evaluation data

**ðŸŽ¯ Objective:**

>This assignment aims to gain practical experience with two popular classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest. You will apply these algorithms to the importance of car features using the car evaluation dataset and compare their performances.

**Tasks to Perform:**

1. Data Exploration:
>Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows.

>Provide a brief overview of the dataset, including the number of features, the target variable, and any other relevant information.

2. Data Preprocessing:
>Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).

>Identify and select the most relevant features for your model. Provide a brief explanation of why these features were selected.

>Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

3. Decision Tree Implementation:
>Train a Decision Tree classifier on the training data.

>Use the model to make predictions.

>Visualize the Decision Tree using available plotting libraries.

>Discuss the splitting criteria and the tree structure, explaining key decisions made by the algorithm.

4. Random Forest Implementation:
>Train a Random Forest classifier on the same training data using the same features.

>Compare the Random Forest model's structure with the Decision Tree.

>Highlight the main differences between the two models in terms of their approach to classification.

5. Model Comparison:
>Compare the predictions made by both models on the test data.

>Discuss which model seems to perform better and why, based on your observations from the data.

6. Feature Importance Analysis:
>Analyze and plot the feature importance scores from the Random Forest model.

>Discuss how the most important features impact the model's predictions.
